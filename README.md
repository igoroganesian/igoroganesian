### Hey all 👋

My name is Igor, and I'm a software engineer with a background in psychology and holistic health & wellness, informing my approach to creating thoughtful & effective software solutions. I'm driven by a dual commitment to technical precision and a deep understanding of human experience, ensuring my work is not just functional but also empathetic to user needs.

Off screen, I spend most of my free time:<br>

🪵 Woodcarving<br>
📚 Reading<br>
💃 Dancing<br>
🏃 Keeping Active<br>

I'm always open to collaborations, freelance opportunities, and good conversations. Feel free to reach out!<br>
